Creating Modules
======================================

Setup
--------
```
sudo mv samples /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/dist-packages/
```
Move the samples folder into the python site-packages folder. ** Do not name other folders "samples" ** This can cause conflicts with finding the locations of files when importing.
